            <strong>Punjab (Urdu, Punjabi: پنجاب‬, panj-āb, "five waters":</strong>  About 
            this soundlisten  is Pakistan's second largest province by area, 
            after Balochistan, and its most populous province, with an estimated population 
            of <strong>110,012,442</strong> as of 2017.Forming part of the larger Punjab region of the 
            Indian subcontinent, it is bordered by the Pakistan provinces of Sindh, Balochistan, 
            and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the enclave of Islamabad, and Azad Kashmir. 
            It also shares borders with the Indian states of Punjab, Rajasthan
             and Jammu and Kashmir. The provincial capital of Punjab is the city Lahore, 
             a cultural, historical, economic and cosmopolitan centre of Pakistan where 
            the country's cinema industry, and much of its fashion industry, are based.
            <br>
            <strong>Punjab</strong>  has been inhabited since ancient times. The Indus Valley Civilization,
             dating to 2600 BCE, was first discovered at Harappa. Punjab features heavily
              in the Hindu epic poem, the Mahabharata, and is home to Taxila, site of what 
            is considered by many to be the oldest university in the world.In 326 BCE,
            Alexander the Great defeated King Porus at the Battle of the Hydaspes near Mong,
            Punjab. The Umayyad empire conquered Punjab in the 8th century CE. Punjab was 
            later invaded by Tamerlane, Babur, and Nader Shah. Punjab reached the height of
            its splendour during the reign of the Mughal Empire, which for a time ruled
            from Lahore. Following a successful rebellion, Sikh-led armies claimed Lahore
            in 1759. The administration of the Sikh Empire was based out of Lahore, 
            until its defeat by the British. Punjab was central to the independence 
            movements of both India and Pakistan, with Lahore being site of both the
            Declaration of Indian Independence, and the resolution calling for the 
            establishment of Pakistan. The province was formed when the Punjab province 
            of British India was divided along religious boundaries in 1947 by the Radcliffe
            Line after Partition.<br>

                        Punjab is known in Pakistan for its relatively liberal social attitudes.
                        The province has been strongly influenced by Sufism, with numerous 
                        Sufi shrines spread across Punjab which attract millions of devotees annually.
                        Punjab is Pakistan's most industrialised province with the industrial sector 
                        making up 24% of the province's gross domestic product.Punjab is known in Pakistan 
                        for its relative prosperity, and has the lowest rate of poverty amongst all 
                        Pakistani provinces.A clear divide is present between the northern and 
                        southern portions of the province with poverty rates in prosperous northern Punjab 
                        amongst the lowest in Pakistan,[17] while some in south Punjab are amongst the most 
                        impoverished. Punjab is also one of South Asia's most urbanized regions with 
                        approximately 40% of people living in urban areas.
                         Its human development index rankings are high relative to the rest of Pakistan.
                         Punjab is also the site of the Katasraj Temple, which features prominently in
                          Hindu mythology.Several UNESCO World Heritage Sites are located in Punjab, 
                          including the Shalimar Gardens, the Lahore Fort, 
                         the archeological excavations at Taxila, and the Rohtas Fort.

                The History of Punjab is intertwined with the history of the broader 
                Indian subcontinent and the surrounding regions of South Asia, Central 
                Asia and West Asia. Historically known as Sapta Sindhu, or the Land of Seven 
                Rivers, the name Punjab was given by later Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent.

        <h2 id="tt">Ancient History</h2>
        <p id="pfont">
                The oldest evidence of life in Pakistan has been found in Soan River valley. 
                It was here that some of the earliest signs of humans have been discovered 
                during the excavations of prehistoric mounds.[33] Tools up to two million years 
                old have been recovered in potohar plateau. In the Soan River, many fossil bearing 
                rocks are exposed on the surface. 14 million year old fossils of gazelle, 
                rhinoceros, crocodile, giraffe and rodents have been found there.

    <p id="pfont">
            Tourism in Pakistan is gradually rising as the security situation calms down. 
            The economic corridor is also kicked off with several batches of trade goods 
            reaching Gwadar and Khunjerab Pass. It is likely that business will eventually 
            bloom in this country. Such a country would attract foreign people and local 
            investors as well. Consequently, people would certainly travel within Pakistan, 
            and that is why we have gathered 
            some of the top tourist attractions in the Punjab region.
